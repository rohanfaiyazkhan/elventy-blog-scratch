## Introduction

The intersection of queer studies and surveillance often looks at lives of queer people living in
Western liberal countries such as USA, Canada and UK. While authors such as Puar [^puar] have explored
the particular set of experiences by racialized queer people withinWestern countries, this still leaves
much to be explored in places that still criminalize homosexuality. In this essay, I will in particular
look at queer surveillance of the Bangladeshi LGBTQ+ community. In order to do so, I will look
at surveillance of queer lives in the global context, the colonial hangover of Penal Code 377 that
continues to jeopardize lives of queer people today and a Bangladesh-specific surveillance of queer
lives through the rise of political Islam. In doing so, I will attempt to show how the surveillance of
queer lives is authoritarian in nature. Due to the legacy of queer erasure, it will be impossible to
cover the true impact of surveillance of queer lives without further research, but I intend for this
article to be the basis of my future research into this topic.

## Queer Surveillance

Surveillance has always antagonized those who are thought to be anomalies. For sexual and gender
minorities, this is no exception. As Foucault argued, the state capitalist model that expects
maximum work output from the individual sees sex as a frivolity in all but the most necessary of
circumstances, which is reproduction [^foucault]. When structures of power classify gender and sex for
the intent of maximizing utility to society, a process of normalization takes place.
Under surveillance, one’s membership in society hinges on being as close as possible to the most
optimum or normative position. Kafer and Grinberg [^kafer] argue in an editorial piece on Queer
Surveillance, the intersection of queer studies and surveillance literature reveal that surveillance
technologies such as biometrics and face recognition enforce normative assumptions of gender
and sexuality. Surveillance has always been hostile to those who are seen to deviate from these
assumptions, seeing them as people who must correct themselves and conform to cis-gendered and
hetero-normative standards. Kafer and Grinberg contend that non-normativity under surveillance
is not only encompass gender and sexual orientations, but also tie in class, race, citizenship status
and other social determinants [^kafer].

The intersection between racialized and queer minorities face a different degree of othering.
Puar [^puar] writes extensively about homonationalism, which challenges the notion that liberal
Western countries have transformed over the last thirty years to become safe havens for gendered
and sexual minorities, who are afforded full protection of sovereign rights. Puar refutes that
sovereign rights for gendered and sexual minorities are skewed towards some populations who
enjoy full legal and citizenship rights over others, specifically "racialized others". Examples of this
include immigrant and black transgender people in Canada who typically have lives "demarcated
by poverty" and for whom basic social services such as food banks become perilous to access
[^maynard]. This bias in the surveillance practices eventually becomes encoded in
surveillance technologies such facial recognition technology that encodes both gender and race,
seeing non-normative permutations through a coded gaze [^buolamwini].
It is with the knowledge of this framework that we can see the queerphobic surveillance in
previously colonized nations, and among queer people who live in the Western liberal world but as
a "racialized other", as a lasting hangover from colonialism.

## The Queerphobic Legacy of Colonial Rule

It is important to note that while homosexuality was not a common practice in many formerly
colonized nations, it also was not criminalized. The existence of homosexuality and gender nonconformity
can be observed through numerous references in literature in various countries. Examples
include the Mahabharata which has references to androgynous characters such as Shikhandi
[^epstein]. Rather the origin of laws criminalizing homosexuality in these countries
can instead be traced back to Penal Code 377 of 1860 introduced by British colonial rulers,
which criminalized "sexual acts against the order of nature" [^penal].

Radics [^radics] notes that the introduction of the Penal Code 377 had little to do with the
colonies themselves. Rather they were an extension of the Labouchere Amendment, which banned
acts of gross indecency between men. Radics also notes that the motivation for extending the law
to the colonies were entrenched in orientalism and sexualization of Malaya itself, which the British
felt "feminized men". There were also unfounded concerns of moral and cultural decay among
white European men serving in the colonies.

It is very important to note that orientalism and racism played a key role in the enactment of
Penal Code 377 a full 53 years after the Labouchere Amendment. Sholihyn and Chew [^sholihyn] writes
that the one who helped bring the law into fruition was Sir Thomas Shenton, who saw Singapore’s
male brothels as threatening. The particular source of the threat was not the homosexuality
of Singaporean men, but rather the fact some prominent European men in his government was
copulating with supposedly inferior Asian men at these brothels. This was seen by Shenton as a
threat to the colonial empire and the hierarchy of power established by colonialism.
While sections of the Labouchere Amendment would be repealed and re-enacted in Britain,
its legacy in colonized nations remains long after the end of the British empire. Countries such
as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka still criminalize homosexuality under Penal Code
377, and India and Singapore have only recently repealed the law. Uganda’s much noted Anti-
Homosexual Bill in 2014 is also very much a descendant of the colonial era rule, which Kizito
[^kizito] writes has led to massive state-led violence against sexual minorities in Uganda. This
colonial statute has set an antagonistic relationship between state and the queer "other" in these
nations.

## Queerness Under Authoritarian Gaze in Bangladesh

Thanks in large part to the legacy of Penal Code 377, the lives of sexual minorities in Bangladesh
is one of illegitimacy in the eyes of the government. This illegitimacy deprives them of not only
legal protections, but also makes it impossible for queer organizations to offer support against the
increasing conservative Muslim majority. A large shift in the post-9/11 era of Bangladesh saw
the insecurities stemming from discrimination against Muslims and defensiveness regarding the
Western antagonism towards Islam leading to the rise of conservative Islam in politics. This era
also saw the rise of Hefazat-e-Islam, currently the largest conservative-Islamic political party in
Bangladesh and massive investment by Saudi Arabia into Bangladeshi mosques and madrasahs.
The political side of conservative Islam particularly rejects western influences which it sees as
morally corrupt. Homosexuality is considered to be one of the worst offenders in the list of Western
imports. This is especially ironic because as we have discussed the true Western import was not
homosexuality, but homophobia.

Because actual surveillance of homosexuality is largely impossible, what is actually surveilled
by society is visible indicators of queerness. Queer people are constantly expected to behave as cisgender
and hetero-normative as possible as that is the only parameters under which their existence
is tolerated. This coupled with the lack of legal protection render queer existence as invisible.
Visibility comes with a considerable cost as individuals who cannot or do not comply under their
surveillance can become victims of public shaming at best or violence and murder at worst.
One of the most significant setbacks to the LGBTQ+ community in Bangladesh has been the
double murder of queer activists Xulhaz Mannan and Mahbub Tonoy who were hacked to death in
their apartment by extremist Islamic militants [^france-presse]. This was a major moment
because Xulhaz and Tonoy at the forefront of the queer rights movement at the time and actively
working with many international organizations. The mode of surveillance used against them was
not physical surveillance, but social media. This was a major indicator to queer people that even
online they would have to remain anonymous and invisible.

Following Xulhaz and Tonoy’s murders, many queer people with the privilege to do so took
to escaping to Western countries either seeking political asylum or as immigrants. While this has
worsened the oppression of queer people remaining in Bangladesh, those that have left are not
entirely free of oppression under queer surveillance. Racialized queer immigrants find it difficult to
seek protections assigned for citizens of Western liberal countries. At the same time, Bangladeshi
diasphoras are often more conservative than the society these people escaped from, requiring them
to continue to surveill themselve under the queerphobic authotarian gaze.

## Conclusion

The surveillance of queer lives in Bangladesh have long ties to colonialism and queerphobia under
state surveillance. However, Bangladeshi queer subjects come under another intense mode of societal
and online surveillance. The illegitimate stateperson
relationship and constant erasure and surveillance by society pushes sexual and gendered
minorities under an authoritarian form of surveillance. The sustained erasure of queer narratives
make it difficult to research into the systemic oppression that sexual and gender minorities face,
but forms of resistance under this oppression such as the existence of hidden queer communities
and archives of queer literature bring into light a form of queer resistance that unknown to many
Western queer studies and surveillance studies scholars.
