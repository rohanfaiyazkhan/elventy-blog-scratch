_Physiognomy_ is the study of inferring temperament and character from facial features. There are many links between physiognomy and the study of phrenology, which is the infamous study of deriving character or mental faculties from the bumps on one's skull. Historically both physiognomy and phrenology have been criticized and debunked as being scientifically unsound [^stark2021]. Critics have also pointed out how phrenology and physiognomy exhibit racist, classist and sexist prejudices legitimized through "science", which were used to naturalize the oppression of disenfranchised populations and serve political arguments in favor of colonization and slavery [^thompson2021].

The advent of AI has made it possible for physiognomy to make a resuregence under the guise of AI powered computer vision applications and research. Automated hiring such as HireVue uses facial recognition to analyze the performance of intervewees, recidivism risk for those awaiting bail is decided by algorithms, and crowd surveillance uses automated emotion detection to find suspicious individuals. Top conferences and journals have also published research claiming facial analysis can be used for social categorization such as predicting sexual orientation [^kosinski2017], political orientation [^kosinski2021], criminality [^criminality2016] among others.

It should not be surprising then that both commercial technology using physiognomic AI and academic research justifying its use have come under criticism [^stinson2020] [^stark2021]. Physiognomic AI make assumptions relating the human face and body to characteristics originating from the harmful pseudosciences of phrenology and physiognomy and provides mechanisms for normalizing such assumptions. Methodological and empirical challenges have also been made [^rhue] [^pseudoscience2022], this essay will attempt to focus on the ethical justifications for use of such AI, and in particular address one defence physiognomic AI researchers have used to jusitfy their work.

## A Historic Retrospective on the Origins of Phrenology and Physiognomy

Physiognomy and phrenology can be traced as early as Victorian era Europe where scholars such as Johann Kaspar Lavater and Franz Josef Gall developed and popularized methods of collecting data on faces and skulls in an attempt to form a system of judgement from facial and cranial features [^pearl]. Such theories became very culturally popular in societies such as eighteenth and early nineteenth century Britain where denizens of growing industrial cities could adopt a framework of individual judgement that aligned with many of their held predispositions [^pearl]. As such, the tapestry of Western culture became intertwined with beliefs validating physiognomy, and this practice also meant people had to actively engage in self presentations that were considered favorable by physiognomic beliefs. Adoption of physiognomy into "an important vehicle of liberal ideaology" would also be favorable to establishing power structures of colonialism and slavery [^giustino]. It was convenient to be able to justify subjugation of certain populations if they possessed facial and bodily characteristics that could be interpreted as naturally inferior, and focus on the supposed "social good" of educating these populations on good societal mental faculties [^giustino].

A particularly significant scholar in physiognomy would be British statistician Francis Galton (who was also quite a strong proponent of eugenics). Galton in a rather famously unsuccessful study, attempted to create composite portaits of accused criminals in an attempt to discover facial features that would be indicative of criminality. Despite being unsuccessful in his endeavor, Galton would be extremely influencial in physiognomic research going forward, with researchers now attempting to look for facial characteristics that signified broader social character.

Of course given the luxury of looking back from today, it goes without saying the phrenologists such as Laveter, Gall and Galton did not succeed in establishing any strong evidence linking facial features and social characterization [^schlag]. And after World War II, eugenics, phrenology and physiognomy became rather unpopular. However, this was not due to lack of effort on phrenologists' part. When late phrenology was under attack, researchers had to justify their use of phrenologic research in the face of a large body of evidence discrediting it as a valid field of science. One particular strategy was to focus on proposed social good, choosing to avoid the question of whether phrenology was real but rather direct the question to what benefits phrenology could provide to society (particulary, colonial and settler-colonial Western society) [^schlag]. Even when serious academics were moving away from these pseudoscience, enterpreneurs picked up on the act which would be rather indicative of the future.
